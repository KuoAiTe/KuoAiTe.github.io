                <h2>Scenario of use</h2>
                <p class="lead text-muted">Jason Mars is 16 years old high school senior student from Newman High School, Newman, GA. He completed in Table Tennis League, plays at county level for Coweta, and reached the finals of the SEC High School Table Tennis Championships in 2018. He also coaches younger members at his local table tennis club. Now, he plans to go to college next fall in Georgia or Alabama state. As he doesn’t have financial aids yet, he needs to search for financial aids or scholarships/fellowships. He finds the Scholarship website (https://kuoaite.github.io/hw2/college.html) by his high school teacher’s recommendation. He can use this website to search scholarships by different searching criteria and find the perfect match for his case.</p>
